                    Peter Stoilkov a.k.a. PeterSto, is a DJ from Sofia, Bulgaria.
                    Musically inspired since childhood, he plays his father's old tape recorder at gatherings with friends and classmates and, by playing his favorite songs, draws attention to himself.
                    Inspired by electronic bands in the 1990s such as The Prodigy, Faithless, The Chemical Brothers and after his first party at the Indigo Club in Sofia in 2000, he focused entirely on electronic culture.
                    A series of memorable electronic events begins at Indigo, Yalta, Chervilo, Life House, Blade and many more, as well as major Metropolis and Solar events with DJs such as Sven Vath, Carl Cox, John Digweed, Mark Knight and many others, which turns his notions of DJing upside down.
                    In 2006 he started hard work on creating his own songs and mixes. His first public appearances in city clubs and electronic music bars soon followed.
                    Places like Culture Beat, Life House, Element, Memento, Caldo, Relax and also present him as a rising star on the club's electronic scene in Bulgaria.
                    His style goes from progressive to deep and tech house to techno with some of the best tracks in electronic music.
                    In 2009 he started working on his own label for music production called NONSTOP recording company.
